# Todo
Its a todo list... get it done.

## Must do
* Read data from all of the Fronius endpoints.
* Store that data locally, at least long enough to perform calculations.
* Store base and calculated data into a central location for visualisation. Either local db or influx for Graphana/Home Assistant.

## Extras to get to once it actually works
* Calculate cost data

## If I can figure it out
